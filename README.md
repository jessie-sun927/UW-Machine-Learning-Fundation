# UW-Machine-Learning-Fundation Test Version
This is the first course in ML specialization and it focus on introduction to machine learning algorithms.
  
  
### [Week2](https://github.com/jessie-sun927/UW-Machine-Learning-Fundation/tree/main/week2):
* Describe the input (features) and output (real-valued predictions) of a regression model
* Calculate a goodness-of-fit metric (e.g., RSS)
* Estimate model parameters by minimizing RSS(algorithms to comeâ€¦)
* Exploit the estimated model to form predictions
* Perform a training/test split of the data
* Analyze performance of various regression models in terms of test error
* Use test error to avoid overfitting when selecting amongst candidate models
* Describe a regression model using multiple features
* Describe other applications where regression is useful 


### [Week3](https://github.com/jessie-sun927/UW-Machine-Learning-Fundation/tree/main/week3):
* Decision boundaries and linear classifier
* Train a classifier
* Evaluate classification performance
  
  
### [Week4](https://github.com/jessie-sun927/UW-Machine-Learning-Fundation/tree/main/week4):
* Word count representation for measuring similarity
  - Bag of words model
    - Disadvantage: Rare words are not addressed
  - TF-IDF: Prioritizing important words
    - Upweight words that are frequent in the document but not corpus
    - Downweight words that are frequent in the document but also in the corpus
    
* Distance metrics:
  - Euclidean Distance(scaled,non-scaled)
  - Cosine similarity
    * Cosine similarity allow us to capture the similarity of docus even if their size differ a lot
    * Cosine is essentially the same as Euclidean distance on normalized data
* Retrieving similar documents
  - 1NN
  - KNN
  
* Clustering similar documents
  - known labels: multi-classification problem
  - unknown labels: unsupervised learning problem using k-means algorithm
    
    
### [Week5](https://github.com/jessie-sun927/UW-Machine-Learning-Fundation/tree/main/week5):
* Co-occurrence matrix
* Matrix Factorization
* Cold-start problem 
* Featured matrix factorization
* Performance metric for recommender systems
  - Precision-recall: for a given precision, want recall as large as possible
  - one metric: largest area under the curve(AUC)
  - Another metric: precision at k
  

### [Week6](https://github.com/jessie-sun927/UW-Machine-Learning-Fundation/tree/main/week6):
* Intro to multi-layer neural network models
* Intro to deep learning models
* Pros and cons of deep learning model
* Image retrieval using deep features
