## Week2 Topics:
* Describe the input (features) and output (real-valued predictions) of a regression model
* Calculate a goodness-of-fit metric (e.g., RSS)
* Estimate model parameters by minimizing RSS(algorithms to comeâ€¦)
* Exploit the estimated model to form predictions
* Perform a training/test split of the data
* Analyze performance of various regression models in terms of test error
* Use test error to avoid overfitting when selecting amongst candidate models
* Describe a regression model using multiple features
* Describe other applications where regression is useful 

## Algorithms: 
* Linear regression


## Implementation Details of Programming Assignment:
* Execute programs with the Jupyter notebook
* Load and transform real, tabular data
* Compute summaries and statistics of the data
* Build a regression model using features of the data
