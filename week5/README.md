## Week5 Topics:
* Co-occurrence matrix
* Matrix Factorization
* Cold-start problem 
* Featured matrix factorization
* Performance metric for recommender systems
  - Precision-recall: for a given precision, want recall as large as possible
  - one metric: largest area under the curve(AUC)
  - Another metric: precision at k



## Algorithms 
* Recommend songs





## Implementation Details of Programming Assignment:
* Execute song recommendation code with the Jupyter notebook
* Load and transform real, song data
* Build a song recommender model
* Use the model to recommend songs to individual users
* Use groupby to compute aggregate statistics of the data
